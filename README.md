This repository is an attempt to address parking space post-processing functionality using a modeling approach.

It primarily includes the creation of a model training dataset (generated by simulating real data distributions), the model structure, training code, and visualization tools.

Currently, it has not been fully implemented for practical engineering use, mainly because the problem being modeled is an ​ill-posed problem​
, whose singularity prevents the model from achieving satisfactory fitting performance. Due to the failure to meet the required accuracy, this method has been temporarily shelved.
